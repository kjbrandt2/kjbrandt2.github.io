Most inspection pain around audit trails is not about the audit trail feature. It’s about governance: what is captured,who reviews it,where evidence lives,and how long you can produce it on demand.

## Starter checklist
1) Define scope (systems and records that support GxP decisions)
2) Confirm event coverage (create,modify,delete,override,access)
3) Set review requirements (who reviews,how often,what triggers review)
4) Define retention (records+metadata+raw logs+reports)
5) Validate retrieval (can you produce it quickly,consistently,completely)
6) Ensure traceability (signal->review->decision->action)
7) Tie to SOPs (roles,escalation,investigation paths)

## Visual checklist

A simple rule: if you can’t retrieve the audit trail record package quickly,you don’t have audit trails as a control. You have a hope.
