## The Four Layers of Control

Building a strong control strategy starts with understanding its layers.  
At Alto Ridge, we group controls into four practical layers:

1. **Material controls** – specs, CoA review, supplier qualification, incoming inspection  
2. **Process controls** – CPPs/CMAs, in-process checks, alarms, and trend review  
3. **Equipment controls** – calibration, maintenance, cleaning/sterilization, automated interlocks  
4. **People controls** – training, qualification, behaviors, and documented roles

## Practical Takeaways

- **Put at least one control in each layer** for every critical risk.  
- **Define what “failure” looks like per layer** (out of spec, missed check, overdue PM, untrained operator, etc.).  
- **Assign owners and review cadence** so each layer has someone clearly accountable.  
- **Keep evidence easy to retrieve** (batches, logs, training records, deviations, CAPAs).

A robust control strategy isn’t just a slide—it’s a living system that makes day-to-day decisions easier and keeps you inspection-ready.
