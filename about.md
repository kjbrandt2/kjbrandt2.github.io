## Kenneth Brandt

I’m a **director-level GCP & GxP Quality Systems and Quality Operations leader** with 20+ years across biopharma, sterile manufacturing, biologics/CDMOs, and consulting.

I help teams build **inspection-ready systems that work day-to-day** — not just on paper — across clinical and manufacturing environments.

## What I’m known for

### Inspection readiness (FDA / EMA / MHRA)
- Readiness planning, evidence strategy, and “storyboards” that hold up under questioning  
- Mock inspections / audits and SME coaching  
- Practical documentation and governance that reduces scramble and rework

### GCP / GMP quality systems that scale
- Deviations, CAPA, change control, risk management, training, and metrics  
- Phase-appropriate QMS design (build what you need now, with an upgrade path)  
- Cross-functional alignment between Clinical Ops, PV, CMC/Tech Ops, QA, and IT

### Vendor oversight (CROs, CDMOs, labs)
- Qualification and monitoring programs  
- Quality agreements / QTA support  
- Issue management: signals → investigations → CAPA effectiveness → trend prevention

## How I help (typical engagements)

### Rapid assessment + plan (30/60/90)
A structured gap assessment with a prioritized plan, owners, and evidence targets.

### CAPA remediation + effectiveness
Evidence-ready remediation that improves outcomes and stands up to audit scrutiny.

### Inspection readiness support
Readiness packs, storyboards, mock inspections, and targeted team coaching.

### Vendor quality oversight programs
Right-sized oversight that improves control without slowing the business.
