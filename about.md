## Kenneth Brandt

I work in **GCP+GxP quality systems and quality operations** with 20+ years across biopharma,sterile manufacturing,biologics/CDMOs,and consulting.

I help teams build **inspection-ready systems that work day-to-day** across clinical and manufacturing environments,with evidence that holds up under FDA/EMA/MHRA scrutiny.

---

## What I do

### Inspection readiness (FDA/EMA/MHRA)
- Readiness planning,evidence strategy,and inspection storyboards that hold up under questioning
- Mock inspections/audits and SME coaching
- Practical documentation and governance that reduces scramble and rework

### GCP/GMP quality systems that scale
- Deviations,CAPA,change control,risk management,training,and quality metrics
- Phase-appropriate QMS design(build what you need now,with an upgrade path)
- Cross-functional alignment between Clinical Ops,PV,CMC/Tech Ops,QA,and IT

### Vendor oversight (CROs,CDMOs,labs)
- Qualification and monitoring programs
- Quality agreements/QTA support
- Issue management:signals→investigations→CAPA effectiveness→trend prevention

## How I help (typical engagements)

### Rapid assessment+plan (30/60/90)
A structured gap assessment with a prioritized plan,owners,and evidence targets.

### CAPA remediation+effectiveness
Evidence-ready remediation that improves outcomes and stands up to audit scrutiny.

### Inspection readiness support
Readiness packs,storyboards,mock inspections,and targeted team coaching.

### Vendor quality oversight programs
Right-sized oversight that improves control without slowing the business.

## Adjacent regulated work (beyond biopharma)

I’ve also supported regulated product environments beyond traditional biopharma,including wineries/production operations and cosmetics/personal care.

The common thread is the same:documentation that matches reality,control of change,supplier oversight,traceability,investigation discipline,and evidence you can defend.

### Wineries/production operations
- Sanitation programs,process controls,and practical SOPs
- Traceability,lot controls,and deviation-style issue handling
- Vendor/supplier oversight and audit readiness support

### Cosmetics/personal care
- GMP-style operating discipline for quality-critical steps
- Supplier qualification,raw material controls,and incoming quality
- Complaints,investigations,CAPA-style corrective actions,and change control
- Labeling/content controls and evidence management
