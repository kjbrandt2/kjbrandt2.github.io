# Kenneth Brandt

I work in GCP+GxP quality systems and quality operations with 20+ years across biopharma,sterile manufacturing,biologics/CDMOs,and consulting.

I help teams build inspection-ready systems that work day-to-day across clinical and manufacturing environments,with evidence that holds up under FDA/EMA/MHRA scrutiny.

## What I do

### Inspection readiness (FDA/EMA/MHRA)
- Readiness planning,evidence strategy,and inspection storyboards that hold up under questioning
- Mock inspections/audits and SME coaching
- Practical documentation and governance that reduces scramble and rework

### GCP/GMP quality systems that scale
- Deviations,CAPA,change control,risk management,training,and quality metrics
- Phase-appropriate QMS design (build what you need now,with an upgrade path)
- Cross-functional alignment across Clinical Ops,PV,CMC/Tech Ops,QA,and IT

### Vendor oversight (CROs,CDMOs,labs)
- Qualification and monitoring programs
- Quality agreements/QTA support
- Issue management: signals->investigations->CAPA effectiveness->trend prevention

## How I help (typical engagements)
- Rapid assessment+plan (30/60/90)
- CAPA remediation+effectiveness with evidence that survives scrutiny
- Inspection readiness support (readiness packs,storyboards,mock inspections)
- Vendor quality oversight programs that improve control without slowing the business

## Adjacent regulated work
My core work is biopharma and clinical/manufacturing GxP. I have also supported adjacent regulated environments where the same fundamentals matter: documented controls,traceability,validated decisions,and defensible records.
- Food+beverage and winery operations (quality programs,sanitation controls,traceability,documentation)
- Cosmetics/personal care (supplier controls,documentation discipline,claims governance)
- Other quality+compliance programs where “if it isn’t documented,it didn’t happen” is still true

## Who this site is for
- Teams building or upgrading GxP systems without overbuilding
- Leaders who need inspection readiness that works day-to-day
- Teams adopting new tools (including AI-enabled workflows) that need governance,monitoring,and traceability
