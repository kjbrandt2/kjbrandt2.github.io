## Kenneth Brandt

I help clinical and manufacturing teams build inspection-ready quality systems across **GCP/GMP oversight**, **vendor quality**, **CAPA effectiveness**, and **phase-appropriate QMS design**.

### What I Do
- Inspection readiness support (mock audits, readiness packs, storyboards)
- CAPA remediation and effectiveness (evidence-ready)
- Vendor oversight programs (qualification, monitoring, QTA support)
- Quality governance, metrics, and operating cadence

### Industries
Biotech & biologics, clinical programs, CDMOs/CROs, labs — plus cross-industry work where quality systems translate.
