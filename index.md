# Kenneth Brandt

**Director, GCP & GxP Quality Systems** • Biotech & Biologics

I help teams build **inspection-ready quality systems that actually work day-to-day** across clinical and manufacturing — with strong **vendor oversight**, **CAPA effectiveness**, and **phase-appropriate QMS design**.

---

## What I work on
- **Inspection readiness** (FDA / EMA / MHRA)
- **GCP/GMP quality systems**: deviations, CAPA, change control, risk management, training
- **Vendor QA oversight** (CROs, CDMOs, labs) and quality agreements / governance
- **Metrics + operating cadence** that leadership can run and auditors can follow

---

## Typical ways I help
- **Rapid QMS assessment + 30/60/90 plan** (priorities, owners, evidence targets)
- **CAPA remediation + effectiveness** (audit-proof, outcome-driven)
- **Inspection readiness support** (readiness packs, mock audits, SME coaching)
- **Vendor oversight programs** (qualification, monitoring, escalation pathways)
